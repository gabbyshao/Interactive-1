		<h2>Camomile Tea</h2>
		<h4>-by Katherine Mansfield</h4>
			<p>


			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
			Outside the sky is light with stars;
			</p>
			<p>
				&nbspThereâ€™s a hollow roaring from the sea.
			</p>
			<p>
				And, alas! for the little almond flowers,
			</p>
			<p>
				&nbsp&nbspThe wind is shaking the almond tree.
			</P>
		<br>
			<p>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHow little I thought, a year ago,
			</p>
			<p>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn the horrible cottage upon the Lee
			</p>
			<p>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThat he and I should be sitting so
			</p>
			<p>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAnd sipping a cup of camomile tea.
			</p>
		<br>
			<p>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLight as feathers the witches fly,
			</p>
			<p>
				&nbsp&nbspThe horn of the moon is plain to see;
			</p>
			<p>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp By a firefly under a jonquil flower
			</p>
			<p>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA goblin toasts a bumble-bee.
			</P>
		<br>
			<p>

				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe might be fifty, we might be five,
			</p>
			<p>
				So snug, so compact, so wise are we!
			</p>
			<p>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspUnder the kitchen-table leg
			</p>
			<p>
				&nbsp
				My knee is pressing against his knee.
			</p>
		<br>
			<p>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOur shutters are shut, the fire is low,
			</p>
			<p>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe tap is dripping peacefully;
			</p>
			<p>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe saucepan shadows on the wall
			</p>
			<p>
				&nbsp&nbspAre black and round and plain to see.
			</p>
